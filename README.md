This app is designed to let everyone submit pasta shapes and review them! Users will post reviews for particular pasta shapes, letting the whole world know their opinions on all the pastas available! From angel-hair to ziti!

You will be able to navigate to category pages and see a list of pastas that have already been added to the app. When you are signed in there will be forms that will allow you to post more pastas to that category. Once you have created a pasta you will be able to leave a review of the pasta; this consists of a required title, a required rating, and an optional description and recipe (you must provide a link).

This app was created by the contributors as part of the curriculum at Launch Academy. All students at Launch Academy spend two weeks working with peers on a group project, learning the ins-and-outs of developing collaboratively on a team. All features were designed as a group and developed via pair-programming. We are all apprentices, so hopefully there isn't too much spaghetti code in here!
